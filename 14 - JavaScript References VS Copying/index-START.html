    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name = 'Wes';
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name = 'wesley';
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team);
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    console.log(players);

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way:
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'hey';
    console.log(team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    console.log(players);

    // we can also use Array.from
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'cool';
    console.log(team5);
    console.log(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 99;
    console.log(captain);
    console.log(person); // person's age has also been modified to 99

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 85});
    console.log(cap2);
    console.log(person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

  const cap3 = {...person};
  console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    console.log(dev);

    dev.name = 'Wesley';
    console.log(wes); // object wes was not modified
    console.log(dev);

    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log(wes); // here object wes was modified because Object.assign only works only 1 level deep
    console.log(dev);

    // one method is to get a function online called cloneDeep
    // or we can use a cheating deepcloning method:

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    dev2.social.twitter = '@strongman';
    console.log(dev2)
    console.log(wes); // wes has not been modified from its previous state
    // this is because:
    // JSON.stringify(wes) returns a string, not an object
    // JSON.parse turn it back to an object and we can a full copy of wes
